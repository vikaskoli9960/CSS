<h1>Barack Obama's Victory Speech</h1>

<body>
    <p>It moves forward because of you. It moves forward because you reaffirmed the spirit that has triumphed over war
        and depression, the spirit that has lifted this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope,
        the belief that while each of us will pursue our own individual dreams, we are an American family, and we rise
        or fall together as one nation and as one people. (Cheers, applause.)

        Tonight, in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our road has been hard, while our
        journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back, and we know in our hearts that
        for the United States of America, the best is yet to come.I just spoke with Governor Romney and I congratulated
        him and Paul Ryan on a hard-fought campaign. (Cheers, applause.) We may have battled fiercely, but it's only
        because we love this country deeply and we care so strongly about its future. From George to Lenore to their son
        Mitt, the Romney family has chosen to give back to America through public service. And that is a legacy that we
        honour and applaud tonight. (Cheers, applause.) In the weeks ahead, I also look forward to sitting down with
        Governor Romney to talk about where we can work together to move this country forward.</p>
